Architecture Constraints
========================

## Functional requirements:


| ID | Requirement                       | 
|----|-----------------------------------|
| 1  | Habit can be viewed               |
| 2  | Habits can be created             | 
| 3  | Habits can be deleted             |
| 4  | Habit attributes can be changed   |
| 5  | Progress of a habit can be viewed |
| 6  | Habits need to be saved           |
| 7  | Users can log progress            |


## Non-Functional requirements:

- UI can be switched to ios easily
- Database location can be varied (local, on server) (Database needs to be decoupled from the logic) 
- Easy to use 
- Easy to extend 
- Modern design

## Organizational requirements:
